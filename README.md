# <Orullian-Portfolio-Site>

## Description

This is a site designed to introduce a prospective employer to the coding work done by Jedediah Orullian.  Potential employers and other site visitors will be able to look at various sections ot the website to learn more about Jedediah.  A strong emphasis was placed on css code when designing the web page.  The page sports a clean and responsive design that is easy to follow and look at.

As this page was being built, I gained a deep respect for including comments in both the css and html files.  This allowed me and will allow future devs to easily see how the code is linked between the css and html files.  Both were written in chronological order from top to bottom, and hopefully this will also make it easy to follow the css code.

Additionally, one of the epiphanies I had while writing the code for this project was the need to place media queries at the end of the css file.  The fact that css code overwrites itself as you move down was lost on me for media queries, until I was struggling to get a display:none line to function properly.  After moving the media queries, the code functioned perfectly.
